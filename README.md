# LHL-MidTerm-Project-Predicting-Flight-Delay-
This repository contains the Lighthouse Labs Data-Science midterm project for Mobola Abubakre, Salma Al-Shehabi and Jade Gibson. 

Content :
* Exploratory analysis questions can be found in the two notebooks.
* Modeling with training and testing sets
* Cleaned test set in csv form.

Task:

Flight delay is an important subject to tackle for air transportation all over the world. There are various reasons for why a flight can get delayed including weather conditions, mechanical problems, high density airports, and security issues.
Knowing the status of the flight is crucial as it plays a role in both the profits and loss of airlines and impacts related industries. Accurately predicting delay times can increase profit and customer satisfaction.
In this project we will explore features that are highly correlated to delays, and how machine learning can use them to improve structure.

Data:

We will be working with data from air travel industry. We will have four separate tables: 1. flights: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in years 2018 and 2019 and January 2020. January 2020 will be used for evaluation(t_submit.csv). 2. fuel_comsumption: The fuel comsumption of different airlines from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month. 3. international_passengers: The passenger totals on different international routes from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month. 4. domestic_passengers: The passenger totals on different domestic routes from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month. The data are stored in the Postgres database
